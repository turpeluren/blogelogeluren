In the spirit of [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/) here is a little of what I'm up to right /now!

#### Connecting

Further efforts to connect with others have lead me to join the [lainchan webring](/posts/lainring) which I found really up my alley.

I joined March's [Lainchan Web Festival](https://newdigitalera.org/special/lainchan-web-festival-march-2024) with a post on the theme [nature](/posts/cradled-by-nature), and submitted my post [Crying out](/posts/crying-out) to February's [Indie Web Carnival](https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships) even though I had already written it in January... Writing collectively like this is fun and I will try to keep participating in Festi-/Carnivals like these.

#### Drawing

Since I got a new drawing tablet for my birthday I've started (trying) to draw digitally more often. Here are some drawings: [02-27](/posts/drawing-2024-02-27), [03-01](/posts/drawing-2024-03-01), [03-07](/posts/drawing-2024-03-07), [03-15](/posts/drawing-2024-03-15).

#### Updating

Maintenance of [randomantagning.se](/posts/randomantagningse) is always looming over me since it needs regular updates at least every semester before the period of uni applications starts. The code is really messy and I finally [rewrote](/posts/random-rewrite) it just a little to update the site more easily. However there is still much room for automation and optimization.

As always I am continuously updating this blog and taking [a picture of my face every day](/posts/potd-webplayer).

#### Collecting

I am collecting songs to dj with, and plan to add a directory of my tracks to this site. My lainring neighbour Nihilist has a really nice [online radio](https://lain.nihilism.network/) which you should check out!

I have also started gathering links to good blog posts and references. Here are some interesting ones I've recently been...

#### Reading about

- [Metamodernism](http://metamoderna.org/the-difference-between-post-and-metamodernism/?lang=en)
- [Great work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)
- [Focus](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/multi-armed-bandit)

That last one, I referenced in [Organizing ideas](/posts/organizing-ideas) and I can announce that although I am still very scattered and avoiding any responsibilities, I have mildly  successfully organized myself to focus one a smaller amount of things *at a time*. Right now my points of focus (except for uni courses) are note taking and drawing and recently updating [randomantagning](/posts/randomantagningse) as well as gathering some music.

Akin to the articles on [Metamodernism](http://metamoderna.org/the-difference-between-post-and-metamodernism/?lang=en) and [Great work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), I'm currently interested in are how new ideas come about and how we collectively explore reality, as well as how we can use our knowledge to the best of our ability to solve many problems facing Earth's living organisms.
