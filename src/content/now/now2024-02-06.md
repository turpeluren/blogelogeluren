In the spirit of [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com/) here is my first update of what I am doing /now!

Since August 2023 I am living in Ume√• studying Computer Science. It was a rough time of only calculus from October until recently and now I am chilling out with data structures and discrete maths.

For long, I have felt like writing and eventually got around to setting up this blog where I can write posts in markdown (as opposed to my earlier html blog). I have started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to jot down thoughts. Writing them out really helps me think through and concretize the vague ideas spinning round my head.
#### Some recent thoughts

- [Crying out](/posts/crying-out)
- [Goals and practices for the blog](/posts/blog-goals-and-practices)
- [Organizing ideas](/posts/organizing-ideas)
- [‚ù§Ô∏èüëæ](/posts/ili)

I have also started reading other people's blogs and generally browsing the internet more. Reading a blog for entertainment makes me feel much better than watching youtube or something which I used to do much more. Reading blogs is also better for learning new things and it just generally gets me excited! 

A lot of what I read is about retaking the web & making it [cheap](https://potato.cheap/), finding ones place in the world, blogging / digital gardening, interconnectedness & solarpunk sustainability. 
#### Inspirations right now

- [Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then), swedish (like me!) writing interesting thoughts
- [Erelend](https://blog.erlend.sh/reclaiming-my-digital-identity), norweigan neighbor and indie web bonfire builder
- [TodePond](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/), genre and gender bending coder / videomaker
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), tends a digital garden of fantastic quality

Mostly I still spend my time developing the blog. However, I would like to get back to working on my Rave simulator game as well as drawing more. As always, I am still taking [a picture of my face every day](/posts/potd-webplayer).
