I love to hang online, people do crazy nice stuff here and i'm connected to the whole world. 

But i also love to hang irl, even though it means limiting myself to a specific subculture/social circle/city. I love the grit of the real world and just hanging out late at bars in a city, feeling like a low life street rat, enthralled in neonous action, pumping through the veins of the city.

Irl often feels like a very creative space and I can riff on a lot of funny concepts and thoughts with my friends. They are exuberant with ideas, but anything meaningful rarely makes it out of those mileues, and it's never bleeding edge. It is only when home; when at ease, i can actually put in work that bares fruit. Work, however, which often seems negatively correlated with inspiration.

The web is ofc also immensely creative. It's like following the white rabbit into wonderland, and I am time and time again astonished by the individuals & their creations residing here. In spite of being connected to the front line of human consciousness, the sheer wealth of shiny objects online make me feel a spectator rather than a participant.

'Tis the 'live' context that is somewhat missing from my online presence & work. I am just rambling into the ether(net) but devoid of social context. My best ramblings have come through me when out and about-- at 3 in the morning walking home with a friend. Marvelous spaces of potential have opened themselves in the guise of street lamps, yet always in the moment then lost to time.

I struggle to get to the point of actually creating with others. My current 'styles' of record keeping take much effort, and I am often lost in perfectionism. Perhaps that just is my jam, but what I really need is a *jamming* medium-- like playing with a band or carrying a movie camera. To capture the jazz of irl, and net it for the web.

**Ideally:** Work during the day. When a wall is hit / inspiration is lost, go meet friends and have fun. Go see a local band, whatever. Hit [a third place](/posts/third-place). Talk and chill, spill ur ideas and reevaluate them. Next day repeat. (throw in some walks in nature as well, I don't have the social battery to hang every day.)
