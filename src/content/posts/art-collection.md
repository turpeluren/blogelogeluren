## My collection of cool interesting art:
Very work in progress, unexhaustive etc. Leave any suggestions u think I might like in the comments. 
### Web based:
- The website [mebious.co.uk](https://lain.wiki/wiki/Mebious.co.uk) from serial experiments lain that is sadly unusable since 2020. 

- Radio station [Hbr1](http://www.hbr1.com/) is also a favourite of mine. 

Rhizome's [collection of surf clubs](https://sites.rhizome.org/surfclubs/) lead me to some interesting projects: 

- [Cloaque](https://www.cloaque.org/) is a long vertical internet collage colab between artists. 

- Sadly also discontinued [dump.fm](https://hyperallergic.com/356346/in-memory-of-dump-fm-an-endlessly-collaborative-image-poem/) seems to have been a perfect shitposting ground. 

- Last but not least [are.na](https://www.are.na/) is just like the [memex](https://worrydream.com/refs/Bush_1945_-_As_We_May_Think_(Life_Magazine).pdf)! Check it out:-)
