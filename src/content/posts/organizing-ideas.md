### I like ideas,
and often have many (potential) project ideas, thoughts, insights etc. spinning around my head.

All these ideas are very exciting, but [focusing](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/multi-armed-bandit) only on a few things at a time is the only way to ever get somewhere with these things.

So to not let new ideas distract me right away, or so that I can remember to focus on them, eventually at some point... 
### ...I write ideas down.

For the most part I have used the notes app on my iphone. The 'ideas' notes are very fun to read through after a couple of years, but it is no way to organize thoughts, or thinking.

Recently, I have started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write down ideas in a blogish format like this, and [Trello](https://trello.com) to try to organize snippets of thoughts and projects in categories. 

## Todo-list/queue/set
Today, as I felt rather energized, I got thinking about what's on my todo-list. Not only my boring day-to-day list of chores but the list of things I *want* to do. That list is not exactly a list but exists mostly in my head, and pieces of it are scattered around my Trello 'Ideas' board. What is not really working is when a new idea joins in, it kinda just gets added to the top of the queue, since I am usually most excited about the latest idea or project. It is however rare that I take something *out* of the queue. 

So, today I felt the "queue" (really it's just a large set) was getting a tad too large. After all, I can't even remember all the stuff that's in the queue---They just sometimes show up and I think:  *"Hey, that's also a thing I am doing/have been wanting to do!"*

If I try to think of some examples of "current" projects and ideas I have popping through my head semi-regularly right now there is (in kinda this order of excitement/deadline dread):
- Get started with my new drawing tablet.
- Booktrips to Berlin and Stockholm.
- Output my thoughts.      *< psst,.. doing this one right now!*
- Usually something to study for uni.
- Find tracks and practice Dj:ing.
- Read about/start to practice some spirituality.
- Continue development on the blog.
- Bleach and draw on some T-shirts.
- Catch up on stabilizing my [picture of the day](/posts/potd-webplayer).
- Continue development of my Rave simulator game.
- Get a password manager.
- Apply for a job during the summer.
- Continue development on my [terminal website](/posts/terminal-website).
- Find a driving school and get my drivers license.
- Eventually get new screen printing gear.
- Eventually get a new tattooing machine.
- Maintain [randomantagning.se](/posts/randomantagningse).
- Finish the last part of a web development course.
- Do some business of websites for other people.

Fuck! That was way more than I initially remembered. As you can guess, my investment in each point drastically dwindles after the first few. (But they're still naggning my mind.)

## Focus!
The latest idea was to implement some kind of ***focus***. I was thinking a Trello board with only a few, nicely hand picked, areas to work on. That would mean I could actually put everything else on the shelf instead of having to worry about it once in a while, and maybe get some actual work done on the items in ***focus***. 

Another idea is to allocate time for all the items I cant scrap. So that I can work on several things but keep them from conflicting. But that sounds like a biig step for me---I am *not* a planner. Maybe I would need a calendar of some sort. I have heard about [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and believe it could be everything that Obsidian, Trello and a calendar is at once. (Just realized Obsidian also has "Canvases".) I also heard it is a bit too bloated with features and has a bit of a learning curve. I should probably put it in the todo.....

Maybe I will implement the ***focus*** board, maybe I will learn to plan. Maybe I will do neither of those. At least writing this out has helped me some of the way. Since I am into the hole thing of [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) this piece on **Organizing ideas** can continue to grow here on the site, as my understanding of the topic deepens. 

How do *you* organize your thoughts?

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
