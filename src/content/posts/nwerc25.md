description: I participated in the Northwestern Europe Regional competitive programming Competition 2025!

A month ago, "competitive programming" was a term I barely recognized--Today, I participated in the Northwestern European Regional Competition ([NWERC](https://2025.nwerc.eu/)) 2025 in Karlsruhe, Germany!

Together with another CS- and one math student, we formed team UmU (get it? we're from Umeå University). My teammates had both qualified through the Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest ([NCPC](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2025/)), while I was recruited in lack of a third eligible contestant, unable to decline a free holiday. Before the competition, we actually got interviewed by the university, archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20251207002130/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.umu.se%2Fnyheter%2Fde-representerar-universitetet-i-programmeringstavling_12149645%2F).

With the small amount of practice we managed to squeeze into the month before, we were very happy to complete 6 out of 12 [problems](https://judge.cpulm.org/public/problems) during the competition! My teammates are much to thank for cracking some tough ones.

I am very pleased with the whole event and would like to extend my thanks to any organizers reading this for a wonderful weekend! As a nerd, it can be frightful to initiate contact with other nerds. Alas, I did have some most delightful encounters:) (Even though I must admit I fled the board games room on Saturday)

Looking very much forward to next year when I hope to actually qualify, and get further acquainted with the competitive programming community!
