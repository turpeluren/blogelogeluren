I finally managed to add page views to [Bar Total](/posts/bar-total)! ٩(^‿^)۶ Thanks to a post by [Kanani Nirav](https://dev.to/kanani_nirav/page-views-counter-netlify-dynamic-site-challenge-using-netlify-blobs-314c) it was very easy to add using Netlify's blobs. I am continually amazed how much fun stuff I get there for free, to bury myself deeper in lock in 🔒 – but hey! It's only for funsies :)

Now go read my [post about being a vampire](https://bartotal.digital/posts/jag-och-min-flickv%C3%A4n-%C3%A4r-vampyrer/) (it's in Swedish but you have some built in translator in ur browser right?) and pump that view counter! (っ´ω`c)♡
