Jungle DJ character. I like how the general shapes of the character came out, but the rendering isn't exactly my style yet.. Would like it to be more graff style and a bit ruffer, thicker, more dynamic lines. Gotta find the right brush. Background and colors are also hard. It is not my strong suit but can be fun working on.
