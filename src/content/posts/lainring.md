description: I joined the Lainchan webring!
share: "true"
---

I joined the [Lainchan](https://lainchan.org) [webring](https://indieweb.org/webring)! Webrings are pretty cool and I had seen some of them before, wanting to join one, but I hadn't found my match until now. It was [foreverliketh.is](https://foreverliketh.is/)'s site, with a terrific collection of webrings, that lead me to Lainchan.

The lainring is decentralized so there is no "master" copy or ultimate directory with every site. I mainly got my sites from [sizeof.cat](https://sizeof.cat/post/lainring/), but [yukinu](https://yukinu.com/webring.html) for example has a different set of sites. Would be fun to scrape up everyone some time. 

The ring is joined from [this](https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/73638.html) thread on Lainchan which is the 12th webring thread. Older archived threads: [11](https://web.archive.org/web/20230915203238/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/70358.html), [10](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608152941/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/68824.html), [9](https://web.archive.org/web/20230623171712/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/63471.html), [8](https://web.archive.org/web/20220910112122/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/58746.html), [7](https://web.archive.org/web/20220323233422/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/54827.html), [6](https://web.archive.org/web/20211112180958/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/49373.html), [5](https://web.archive.org/web/20210807142005/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/46277.html), [4](https://yukinu.com/lets-create-a-webring-pt4.html), [3](https://web.archive.org/web/20210129015631/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/37647.html), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20201201190843/https://lainchan.org/%CE%A9/res/33813.html) and [1](https://lainchan.org/Î©/res/29660.html).

It's cool to see that some of the sites are hidden services on the Tor network, I2P, freenet, yggdrasil & ipfs--most of which I had never even heard of! Lainions are nifty!

You can also subscribe to the members feeds (like rss), which I haven't yet added to my index.

My webring page can currently be reached on [turpelurpeluren.online](/posts/turpelurpeluren-online) by typing `webring`, but I probably want to add it here as well since this is where i 'live' rn :3
