Some people experience high internal pressure to build insanely advanced bases in Minecraft. It is a problem with the mechanisms of which I am well acquainted. The joy of creative expression appropriated by a desire for achievement leads to pressure, motivational death & ultimately paralysis.

People now hate the “internet” for this reason. The struggle of being noticed is killing creativity. An increasingly advanced product is created by an increasingly one-dimensional person. “The art advances and the artisan recedes” (Alexis de Tocqueville). *2000 hours in Minecraft hardcore—I built the ULTIMATE base*: You can “admire what the worker does, but you will despise what he is” (Wilhelm von Humboldt), for he is a machine without a soul, enslaved by an increasingly extreme struggle to please a fucking algorithm.
