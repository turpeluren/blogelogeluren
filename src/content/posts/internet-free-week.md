I'm doing 1 week with no online entertainment.

The goal is to not get stuck in consumer mode and rather do stuff I actually like, as well putting time into school work. I hope this will make space for more creativity and peacefulness. 
### Rules:

- Offline entertainment is fine for now...
- Movies (streaming) have been fine as well…
- Playing music is fine
- I can read max one article from my rss feed a day
- Max three news stories in my news app a day
- I can use the internet for schoolwork and project related stuff (like googling a problem)
- But NOT for entertainment
- Messaging is ok (I don’t do it alot)
- Checking my email minimally is ok

I can still publish to the blog.

### Results

- After *three days* it's not really much of a difference. I've not been that strict but I haven't been watching youtube or anything. When I'm using online services I try to not spend too long using them – like im not looking up artists on spotify but just quickly favouriting the song. I also try to avoid my phone as much as possible.
  
  I would like to actually slow down more and for instance take time to read or draw during the day. Projects like [adding backlinks](/posts/backlinks) are an easy draw of my time, and I'm thinking of restraining more of my technological use. However, I will keep these rules for 1 week and then evaluate.
