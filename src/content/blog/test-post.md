  Testing out this blog template and getting to know markdown etc.
---

I am getting to know this nifty blog template [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) by [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev/).
Thank you for that!

## Table of contents

## Header

I really like `these` fields and just learned that the ` symbol is called a backtick.

`slug` was also a new word for me. (In the URL above, "test-article" is the slug).

```ts
// typescript will be interesting to learn
// (yes, this is typescript)
```

### Cursive sub-header

#### Sub-sub-header why not

Here is the sample frontmatter for a post.

```yaml
# what's yaml?
---
this: is yaml?
---
```

## Markdown

I've actually never written in markdown before.

```md
## Markdown

I've actually never written in markdown before.
```

## Learning

> Aha! A little comment!

### Remember how add images

```md
![something](@assets/images/example.jpg)
```

![something](@assets/images/AstroPaper-v3.png)
<img src="../../assets/images/AstroPaper-v3.png" alt="something">

The recommended size for OG image is **_1200 X 640_** px.

Bye bye!
