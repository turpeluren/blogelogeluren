Hiii, I'm turpelurpeluren. This blog is for getting my mind out easily and resides on a subdomain of my [personal website](/posts/turpelurpeluren-online). If you'd like to now more about me (as in my living situation) check out the [/now](/now) page.

For anyone interested my Myers-Briggs type is INFP. My enneagram type might be 9w1 or 5w4, I am not sure... In the scales of "Big Five" I score high in openness and agreeableness, mid in conscientiousness and neuroticism, and low in extraversion. I love personality tests, but an even more interesting model is [Spiral Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics), which you can read about on this terrific [spiral blog](https://spirals.blog/). I just recently discovered [the Four Fields of Developement](https://metamoderna.org/the-four-fields-of-development-and-why-communism-killed-100-million-people/), which might be an even more promising model.

If you're curious to see what I look like in not-ASCII check out my photo project in the [pic of the day-webplayer](/posts/potd-webplayer)!
